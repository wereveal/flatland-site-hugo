Join us for a our traditional Christmas Eve service this year. Together we'll hear the story of Jesus' birth and classic Christmas music. We'll cap it off with a traditional candle lighting. Because of local mandates, we will have limited space for our two services, so be sure to pre-register to reserve your spot.

If you'd like to attend virtually, [we have that option too.](/events/christmas-eve-2020-online)
