Join us for a unique and intimate Christmas Eve service from your own living room. Together we'll hear the story of Jesus' birth and classic Christmas music. We'll cap it off with a traditional candle lighting. But don't worry, if you're staying home, pre-register and we'll send you a box with all the supplies you need to be a part of the service, including candles and children's activities.
