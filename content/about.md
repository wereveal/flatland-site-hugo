## Our Values

There are a few things that just make us _us_. We call them values, and we have five of them that define the way we do ministry, the team we surround ourselves with, and the leaders we put in place.

### Authenticity

Jesus has always been about meeting people where they are. No fronts or facades. We strive for authenticity in every aspect of Flatland Church, from the moment you step on our campus to the last song sung, we want you to see who we really are, and we want to see the real you.

### Love

Love has always been at the core of Christ’s mission here on Earth. Jesus told his disciples in [John 13:35](http://biblehub.com/john/13-35.htm) that the world will know we are his disciples by our love for one another. We strive to have an environment of love and respect for one another, where needs are met and relationships flourish. One of the best ways to experience meaningful Christian relationships here at Flatland Church is to join a life group.

### Transformation

In [2 Corinthians 3:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%203:18) the Apostle Paul encourages his friends at a church in Greece to continue being transformed from glory to glory. We value life transformation here at Flatland Church. We believe that becoming more like God and moving closer to the center of His Kingdom is a life-long journey. We desire to equip you for the journey through inspiring teaching, educational class, and regular life coaching.

### Collaboration

Here at Flatland Church we know we can’t do this journey to the center of God’s Kingdom alone. That’s why we value collaboration in everything we do.

### Enthusiasm

Enthusiasm is the belief in the special revelations of the Holy Spirit. We believe that God moves toward us when we draw near to Him.

## Our Beliefs

Flatland is a member of a cooperative fellowship of churches called the [Assemblies of God](https://ag.org/). Some of our non-negotiables are the Bible as inspired Word of God, salvation through Christ, and baptism in the Holy Spirit.
