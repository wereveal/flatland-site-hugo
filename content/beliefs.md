At Flatland we try to keep things simple. That's why we explain the Good News of Jesus with a simple circle. You can watch our video on what we call "Circle Theology."

## Fundamental Truths

Flatland is a member of a cooperative fellowship of churches called the [Assemblies of God](https://ag.org/). You can check out the full list of the [16 Fundamental Truths of the AG](https://ag.org/beliefs/statement-of-fundamental-truths), which we both affirm and adhere to. Of course, a list without an explanation can often be unhelpful, that's why we encourage you to attend our Next Step class to learn more about our vision, values, and beliefs.
