Flatland is a member of a cooperative fellowship of churches called the [Assemblies of God](https://ag.org/). The list below is something that we every church in our fellowship affirms, and we ask that each of our [Homes of Influence](/homes-of-influence) affirm them too. Of course, a list without an explanation can often be unhelpful, that's why we encourage you to attend our Next Step class to learn more about our vision, values, and beliefs.
