Flatland Youth meets every Wednesday night at [Flatland 144](/locations/flatland-144). Our structure is unique in that we spend the majority of our time together in grade specific small groups. Our night begins with an inspiring message, followed by extended small group discipleship discussing the nights topic. We believe that these in-depth conversations will help transform the lives of students. Lastly, we come together to respond to God through prayer and worship.

BLITZ (n) â€“ crazy fun, high energy night with free food, games, and prizes.

Once a series we also have a night called Blitz. Blitz is a great starting place to get involved. We encourage students to invite their friends to church and we have specifically designed Blitz to be an easy opportunity to do so.  Every Blitz we provide free food and a crazy twist to the night. During Blitz, all of the youth small groups come together to participate in events such as water balloon fights, escape rooms, video game competitions, and many other exciting challenges. 

Throughout the year we also offer several events to help students move closer to the center of God's Kingdom such as Summer Camp, Fall Retreat, and Winter Retreat, as well as several other events throughout the year.
