[**Psalm 73**][1]

_But as for me, I almost lost my footing. My feet were slipping, and I was almost gone. For I envied the proud when I saw them prosper despite their wickedness._ (vv2,3) Of the times in our lives we feel empty, one of them is when we take our eyes off the Lord and all the blessings He lavishes on us and allow ourselves to get distracted by the prosperity of others. Envy can empty us of all that’s good and fill us with desires such as wanting our neighbors to be taken down a notch. Instead of focusing on all the good and righteous blessings the Lord pours into us, we’re distracted with an unrighteous desire to see our neighbor fail.

After all, it’s just not fair, is it? I mean when proud and otherwise wicked people prosper it just isn’t fair. Our thoughts are occupied with the injustice in this world. And a desire for remedy becomes our focus. Have you entertained thoughts such as “If only I could get justice in this case, I would have some peace of mind”?

Are we carrying the burden of injustice today? Do we think about injustice so much that it steals our joy, leaving us empty? Let’s get real. There will be injustice until Jesus comes, people can’t solve that. In fact, in the Serenity Prayer, we ask God for wisdom to know this. Entering God’s presence requires great faith. And, in His presence, we’re blessed with the wisdom to know that when He calls for justice, it’s His intent that we internalize the message, not get distracted by how others should be applying it. When you’re a just person, you’re full of justice and peace of mind. We’re still in the world, just not of it.

> _“Yes, come,” Jesus said. So Peter went over the side of the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus. But when he saw (got distracted by) the strong wind and the waves, he was terrified and began to sink. “Save me, Lord!” he shouted. Jesus immediately reached out and grabbed him. “You have so little faith,” Jesus said. “Why did you doubt me?”_ Matthew 14:29-31(NLT)
