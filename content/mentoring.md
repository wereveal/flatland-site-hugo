Our top priority at Flatland is to help you move to the center of God’s kingdom. God designed your life to function at it’s best when you are closest to him.

If you're exploring Christianity, or if you're still growing in your faith, we recommend mentoring as your first step for your spiritual life.

Mentoring places you under a mature believer with an established program for one-on-one teaching, conversation, and growth. We are currently piloting three different mentorship programs with varying levels of commitment:

- Purpose Driven Life: 6 weeks
- Multiply: 24 weeks
- Discipleship Program: 48 weeks

Sign up to get matched with a mentor and we'll work with you to figure out which program is the right fit.
